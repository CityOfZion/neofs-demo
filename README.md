# neofs-demo

This is an example of a web-based [NeoFS](https://fs.neo.org/) app to create a NeoFS container and upload a file.

NeoFS uses the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) protocol for client/server communication, which is not natively supported by browsers. There is the neofs-http-gw gateway with basic PUT/GET operations for file transfer, however, operations such as checking your NeoFS account balance or creating new containers and access control tables still require gRPC.

In order to access the full feature set of NeoFS from the web, this demo uses the [grpc-web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) protocol in combination with the envoy gRPC proxy, which translates between grpc-web and gRPC.

## Gateway and Proxy Setup

In order to run this app, you must run an instance of neofs-http-gw and envoy.

[Releases Â· nspcc-dev/neofs-http-gw](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-http-gw/releases)

[Building - envoy 1.19.0-dev-acbd96 documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/building.html)

Run neofs-http-gw with the following command:

```
neofs-http-gw -p st1.storage.fs.neo.org:8080 --listen_address 127.0.0.1:8080
```

For envoy, create a new configuration file config.yaml with the following content:

```

    socket_address: { address: 127.0.0.1, port_value: 9901 }

```

Then run envoy with the command:

```
envoy -c ./config.yaml
```
